# Choop
*A text-based programming language that compiles down to Scratch SB2*

Inspired by [ApuC](https://github.com/MegaApuTurkUltra/Scratch-ApuC)
by [@MegaApuTurkUltra](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/MegaApuTurkUltra/).

## Features
- Scoped variables and arrays
- Compile-time type support
- Complete thread safety
- Full recursion support
- Modules, so different sprites can have common functionality
- Inline voids and repeat loops
- Optional parameters
- Constants
- Unicode escaping within strings

## IDE
Once the Choop compiler has been completed, an editor will
be made for Choop.

## Syntax
You can see the documentation for the syntax of
Choop at [Syntax.md](Syntax.md).
To get a feel for the language, check out the
[sample projects](Choop.Demo/Samples/)
You can also view the Antlr grammar file for Choop
[here](Choop.Compiler/Choop.g4).
Eventually, a table of inbuilt functions will be produced.

## Under development
Currently, significant functionality is missing from
from the Choop compiler.

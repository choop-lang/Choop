# Choop
*A C# influenced language that compiles down to SB2.*

Inspired by [ApuC](https://github.com/MegaApuTurkUltra/Scratch-ApuC)
by [@MegaApuTurkUltra](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/MegaApuTurkUltra/).

## Features
- Scoped variables and arrays
- Compile-time type support
- Complete thread safety
- Full recursion support
- Modules, so different sprites can have common functionality
- Inline voids and repeat loops
- Optional parameters
- Constants
- Include new lines within strings

## IDE
Eventually, Choop will come with a Visual Studio extension,
so you can still use an official IDE to program in Choop.

## Syntax
You can see the documentation for the syntax of
Choop at [Syntax.md](Syntax.md).
Alternatively, you can view the
[test script](Choop.Demo/test.ch) or the
[Antlr grammar file](Choop.Compiler/Choop.g4).

## Under development
Currently, significant functionality is missing from
from the Choop compiler.

Ask is now a function that returns a string.
Sprites default to (0, 0), size 100, no colour effects, etc. on load
However, they retain their settings if the green flag is clicked again
Strings have character escaping (\r, \n, \\)

Resources files contain paths to the costume and sounds files within the
project for the sprite.

A Sprite defintion represents the code for 1 sprite.
A Module definition represents an independent set of variables, constants, etc. that
can be added onto a sprite (via the Import attribute)
Modules should be independent from each other

Not case sensitive
Array indexes are 0 based
PascalCase names
No spaces in variables names (use underscore if necessary)
There is no 'this' keyword - names cannot have any conflicts

Variables have scope
Variables outside a sprite / module definition are global
Variables inside a sprite / module defintion are local
Variables inside a method are scoped only to that method
etc.

Sprites can access other sprites
Local variables can be accessed using the (var v) of (sprite v) block
Events can be raised using broadcast blocks

Consts get auto inlined
The "inline" option on a void causes the code to be placed directly inside the caller - a custom block will not be created
The "atomic" option on a method causes the method to run without screen refresh
